# 🌍 AI Language Learning App – Master Prompt (Cursor + Claude 4 Sonnet)

> Use this prompt inside **Cursor + Claude 4 Sonnet** to build a conversation-driven language learning app inspired by Jumpspeak, Busuu, and modern AI tutors.

---

## 🧠 Instructions for Claude:

You are going to act as a full-stack AI product designer, UX strategist, and architect. I want you to guide me through creating a world-class AI language learning app, combining features from the best apps on the market (e.g. Jumpspeak, Busuu).

Work in clear, step-by-step phases to develop core features and designs. I will build it using Cursor, with Claude 4 Sonnet as the helping agent.

The app should be immersive, AI-powered, focused on speaking, and built around short real-life conversation practice.
