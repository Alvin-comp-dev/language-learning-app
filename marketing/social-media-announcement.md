First Comment:
Hi Product Hunt! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Name], the founder of SpeakFlow. We built this app to solve a common problem in language learning - the lack of natural conversation practice. While traditional apps focus on vocabulary and grammar, we believe the best way to learn a language is through actual speaking practice.

Our AI tutor, Sofia, provides a safe space to practice speaking Spanish without the fear of making mistakes. She adapts to your level, provides instant feedback, and helps you build confidence in real-world scenarios.

We're offering Product Hunt users an exclusive deal: Use code PRODUCTHUNT for 3 months of Premium access when you sign up!

I'll be here all day to answer your questions. Looking forward to your feedback! ðŸ™Œ
